---

## Phase 2 — Team & Enterprise Foundation

*Goal: Multi-user, secure, and durable enough for team deployment (5–50 users). Blockers must be resolved before inviting external users or handling real customer data.*

### SEC-001 — Email verification on registration 🔴 Blocker

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Quality Review (GAP-01)

**Problem:** `POST /api/auth/register` creates accounts immediately with no email verification. Any actor can claim any email address, enabling account spoofing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Users cannot log in until email is verified
- ✅ Verification token expires after 24 hours
- ✅ Resend link available on login page
- ✅ Email sent via Resend/SendGrid/SMTP

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/database/migrations/` — `verification_tokens` table; `emailVerified` column on `users`
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` — verification endpoint; login guard
- `backend/src/utils/emailSender.js` — email transport

**Dependencies:** None

---

### SEC-002 — Nonce-based Content Security Policy 🟡 High

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Quality Review (GAP-03)

**Problem:** `appSetup.js:55` uses `'unsafe-inline'` for scripts and styles, enabling XSS attacks.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Per-request nonce generated and injected into `<script>` tags
- ✅ CSP header includes `'nonce-<value>'` only (no unsafe-inline)
- ✅ Vite build process automatically injects nonces

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/middleware/appSetup.js` — nonce generation and CSP directives
- `frontend/vite.config.js` — nonce injection plugin

**Dependencies:** None

---

### SEC-003 — GDPR / CCPA account data export and deletion 🟡 High

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Quality Review (GAP-04)

**Problem:** No way for users to export their data or delete their accounts. GDPR Article 17 & 20 are legal requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ `DELETE /api/auth/account` hard-deletes user and all owned data
- ✅ `GET /api/auth/export` returns JSON archive of all user data within 30 days
- ✅ Deletion request requires email confirmation
- ✅ Audit log records all exports and deletions

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` — export and deletion endpoints
- All repositories — cascade delete logic
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` — Account tab with delete/export buttons

**Dependencies:** None

---

### INF-001 — PostgreSQL support with SQLite fallback 🔴 Blocker

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Effort:** XL | **Source:** Audit

**Problem:** SQLite is single-writer only. No horizontal scaling, no read replicas, permanent data loss on container restart without persistent volume.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Adapter pattern abstracts DB implementation (query, run, get, all)
- ✅ PostgreSQL adapter uses connection pooling (pg)
- ✅ SQLite adapter remains for development/single-instance deployments
- ✅ Migrations run against both databases
- ✅ No performance regression on read-heavy workloads

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/database/adapters/sqlite-adapter.js` — SQLite implementation
- `backend/src/database/adapters/postgres-adapter.js` — PostgreSQL implementation
- `backend/src/database/migrationRunner.js` — dialect-aware migrations
- `docker-compose.yml` — optional PostgreSQL service

**Dependencies:** None

**Breaking Change Notice:** ⚠️ After June 2026, SQLite will no longer be supported in production. Migrate to PostgreSQL via [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

---

### INF-002 — Redis for rate limiting, token revocation, and SSE pub/sub 🔴 Blocker

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Audit

**Problem:** Three critical components are process-local and broken in multi-instance deployments: (1) `revokedTokens` Map, (2) in-memory rate-limit store, (3) SSE broadcasting.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Logged-out users cannot reuse tokens after server restart
- ✅ Rate limiting enforced across all instances
- ✅ SSE events broadcast to all connected clients regardless of instance
- ✅ Redis pub/sub handles 1000+ concurrent connections

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/utils/redisClient.js` — shared ioredis client
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` — token revocation via Redis
- `backend/src/middleware/appSetup.js` — Redis rate-limit store
- `backend/src/routes/sse.js` — Redis pub/sub subscriber

**Dependencies:** INF-001 recommended; can introduce independently but coordinate to avoid double-touching infrastructure

---

### ACL-001 — Multi-tenancy: workspace ownership on all entities 🔴 Blocker

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Audit

**Problem:** Every authenticated user sees every project, test, and run. No workspace, organisation, or team concept. Data isolation is non-existent.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ `GET /api/tests` returns only tests owned by user's workspace
- ✅ User can belong to multiple workspaces
- ✅ `workspaceId` in JWT payload; enforced at middleware layer
- ✅ All entities (projects, tests, runs, activities) scoped to workspace
- ✅ Workspace switching in frontend without re-authentication

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/database/migrations/` — `workspaces` table; FKs on all entity tables
- `backend/src/database/repositories/workspaceRepo.js` — workspace CRUD
- `backend/src/middleware/appSetup.js` — `req.workspaceId` injection
- All route and repository files — workspace scoping

**Dependencies:** INF-001 (PostgreSQL strongly recommended before production)

---

### ACL-002 — Role-based access control (Admin / QA Lead / Viewer) 🔴 Blocker

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Audit

**Problem:** All authenticated users have identical permissions. Admin-only operations (settings, deletion, user management) are only frontend-guarded; API accepts all requests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Three roles: `admin`, `qa_lead`, `viewer` with distinct permissions
- ✅ API endpoints return 403 Forbidden for unauthorized roles
- ✅ Frontend hides UI for unauthorized users
- ✅ Role changes take effect immediately (no token caching)
- ✅ Audit log records all role changes

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/database/migrations/` — `role` column on `workspace_members`
- `backend/src/middleware/appSetup.js` — `requireRole()` middleware
- All route files for mutation operations — role guards
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` — Members / Role management tab

**Dependencies:** ACL-001 (workspaces must exist first)

---

### INF-003 — BullMQ job queue for run execution 🟡 High

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Audit

**Problem:** Run execution is fire-and-forget on HTTP handler thread. Process crash mid-run = lost work and stalled runs. No job persistence or retry logic.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All run executions enqueued to Redis-backed BullMQ queue
- ✅ Failed jobs automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- ✅ Worker can scale horizontally; multiple workers process queue
- ✅ Run status updates in real-time via Redis pub/sub
- ✅ Job history persisted for audit trail

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/routes/runs.js` — replace `runWithAbort` with `queue.add()`
- `backend/src/workers/runWorker.js` — BullMQ Worker implementation
- `backend/src/queue.js` — shared Queue definition
- `docker-compose.yml` — worker service configuration

**Dependencies:** INF-002 (BullMQ requires Redis)

---

### FEA-001 — Teams / email / webhook failure notifications 🟡 High

**Status:** ✅ Complete | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Competitive (S2-03)

**Problem:** When a test run fails, there is no notification. Teams must poll the dashboard.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Send to Microsoft Teams, email, or generic webhook on failure
- ✅ Per-project notification settings (configurable recipients)
- ✅ Notification includes test name, failure message, link to run
- ✅ Notifications respect timezone for scheduling
- ✅ Failure notifications can be muted per project for 1–24 hours

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/utils/notifications.js` — Teams / email / generic webhook dispatcher
- `backend/src/testRunner.js` — call `fireNotifications()` on completion
- `backend/src/routes/projects.js` — notification config CRUD
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` — per-project notification UI

**Dependencies:** None (scheduling already complete)

---

### FEA-002 — TanStack React Query data layer 🔵 Medium

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Audit

**Problem:** All data fetching uses manual `useEffect` + `useState` with no cache, background refresh, optimistic updates, or retry. UX feels sluggish.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All `api.get()` calls wrapped in `useQuery` with automatic caching
- ✅ Mutations use `useMutation` with optimistic updates (e.g., test approval)
- ✅ Failed requests auto-retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ Background refetch every 30s for real-time list updates
- ✅ Stale data clearly marked in UI (faded text, "refreshing..." spinner)

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/main.jsx` — add `QueryClientProvider`
- All `frontend/src/pages/*.jsx` — migrate fetches to `useQuery`
- All `frontend/src/hooks/use*.js` — refactor to TanStack Query

**Dependencies:** None

---

### SEC-004 — MFA (TOTP / passkey) support 🔵 Medium

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Audit

**Problem:** No multi-factor authentication. MFA is a compliance requirement (SOC 2, ISO 27001) and a sales blocker for regulated industries.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Users can enable TOTP-based MFA via QR code + authenticator app
- ✅ Recovery codes generated during MFA setup
- ✅ Users must provide TOTP token at login if MFA enabled
- ✅ Admin can mandate MFA for all workspace members
- ✅ Passkey (WebAuthn) support for passwordless login (stretch goal)

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/routes/auth.js` — MFA enroll, verify, recovery endpoints
- `backend/src/database/migrations/` — `mfaSecret`, `mfaEnabled`, `mfaRecoveryCodes` columns
- `frontend/src/pages/Login.jsx` — MFA verification step
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` — MFA setup and management

**Dependencies:** ACL-001 (allows per-workspace MFA policy)

---

## Phase 3 — AI-Native Differentiation

*Goal: Pull ahead of Mabl, Testim, and SmartBear (including BearQ) with AI-powered capabilities and advanced testing features. These items build the competitive moat.*

---

### DIF-001 — Visual regression testing with baseline diffing 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Competitive

**Problem:** Detects functional failures but not visual regressions — layout shifts, colour changes, component repositioning. Competitors (Mabl, Testim) all have this.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ First approved run captures full-page screenshot as baseline
- ✅ Subsequent runs diff against baseline using pixelmatch
- ✅ Diff view overlays changes (red highlights) on baseline
- ✅ Configurable pixel diff threshold (default: 0.1%)
- ✅ Per-step baseline capture for fine-grained regression detection

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/runner/visualDiff.js` — pixelmatch wrapper
- `backend/src/runner/executeTest.js` — baseline capture and comparison
- `backend/src/database/migrations/` — `baseline_screenshots` table
- `frontend/src/components/run/StepResultsView.jsx` — visual diff overlay

**Dependencies:** None

---

### DIF-002 — Cross-browser testing (Firefox, WebKit / Safari) 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Competitive

**Problem:** Only Chromium supported. Playwright natively supports Firefox and WebKit. Many enterprise customers require Safari compatibility testing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Run modal includes browser selector (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- ✅ Test results include browser used
- ✅ Run detail page shows browser-specific failures
- ✅ Cross-browser runs can execute in parallel

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/runner/config.js` — parameterise `launchBrowser(browserName)`
- `backend/src/testRunner.js` — pass `browserName` from run config
- `frontend/src/components/run/RunRegressionModal.jsx` — browser selector

**Dependencies:** None

---

### DIF-005 — Embedded Playwright trace viewer 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Audit

**Problem:** Playwright traces linked as `.zip` downloads requiring local Trace Viewer installation. Significant debugging friction.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Trace viewer embedded and accessible at `/trace-viewer/`
- ✅ Run detail page includes "Open Trace" button
- ✅ Users can inspect network requests, DOM changes, console logs inline
- ✅ No local installation required

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/middleware/appSetup.js` — serve trace viewer static files
- `frontend/src/pages/RunDetail.jsx` — "Open Trace" button
- Build tooling — copy trace viewer assets on `npm install`

**Dependencies:** None

---

### DIF-015 — Interactive browser recorder for test creation 🟡 High

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Competitive (BearQ)

**Problem:** Users must write descriptions or wait for crawl to create tests. BearQ's primary UX is a visual recorder: click through the app, and it records actions as Playwright code.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ "Record a test" button opens live CDP screencast
- ✅ User interactions captured: clicks, fills, navigations, waits
- ✅ Recording stops automatically on timeout or user action
- ✅ Generated Playwright code matches Sentri's style guide
- ✅ Recorded test can be edited before saving

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/runner/recorder.js` — Playwright action capture
- `backend/src/routes/runs.js` — recording endpoints
- `frontend/src/components/run/RecorderModal.jsx` — live browser view
- `frontend/src/pages/Tests.jsx` — "Record a test" button

**Dependencies:** None (reuses existing CDP screencast infrastructure)

---

### DIF-006 — Standalone Playwright export (zero vendor lock-in) 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Competitive

**Problem:** Vendor lock-in is the biggest objection to AI QA tools. QA Wolf offers this; Sentri does not. Teams want to eject at any time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ `GET /api/projects/:id/export/playwright` generates a zip
- ✅ Zip includes `playwright.config.ts`, `package.json`, one `.spec.ts` per test
- ✅ Exported code runs standalone without Sentri
- ✅ Export includes source URLs and test metadata in comments
- ✅ Frontend "Export as Playwright" button on Projects page

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/utils/exportFormats.js` — `buildPlaywrightZip()` function
- `backend/src/routes/tests.js` — export endpoint
- `frontend/src/pages/Projects.jsx` — export button

**Dependencies:** None
**See also:** MNT-005 (BDD/Gherkin export) — both should share packaging scaffolding

---

### DIF-007 — Conversational test editor connected to /chat 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Competitive

**Problem:** `/chat` route exists but is disconnected from tests. Users who want to modify tests must edit Playwright code directly. Natural-language test editing would be powerful.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ TestDetail.jsx includes "Edit with AI" panel
- ✅ Chat pre-seeded with test's current Playwright code
- ✅ AI response proposes code change
- ✅ Myers diff shows proposed changes inline
- ✅ User can accept, reject, or iterate on suggestion

**Files Changed:**
- `frontend/src/pages/TestDetail.jsx` — AI edit panel
- `backend/src/routes/chat.js` — test-context mode with code diff

**Dependencies:** None (DiffView component ✅ complete)

---

### DIF-008 — Jira / Linear issue sync 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Competitive

**Problem:** Traceability data model stores `linkedIssueKey` and `tags` but no outbound sync. Test failures don't auto-create tickets.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ OAuth integration with Jira and Linear
- ✅ On test failure, auto-create bug ticket with screenshot, error message, run link
- ✅ Per-project sync configuration (enabled/disabled, default project)
- ✅ Sync failures logged but don't block test runs

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/utils/integrations.js` — Jira and Linear API clients
- `backend/src/testRunner.js` — call `syncFailureToIssue()` on completion
- `backend/src/routes/settings.js` — integration config endpoints
- `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` — Integrations tab

**Dependencies:** FEA-001 (shares notification dispatch pattern)

---

### DIF-009 — Autonomous monitoring mode (always-on QA agent) 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Competitive

**Problem:** Sentri is currently triggered. Brand promise is "autonomous QA" — it should watch production continuously.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Per-project monitoring mode: run smoke tests on schedule (configurable frequency)
- ✅ On failure, auto-trigger re-run to distinguish regression from transient
- ✅ Alert on 2 consecutive failures
- ✅ Monitoring status dashboard showing last run, next scheduled run
- ✅ Can be paused/resumed per project

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/scheduler.js` — monitoring job type
- `backend/src/routes/projects.js` — monitoring config
- `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` — monitoring status
- `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetail.jsx` — monitoring config panel

**Dependencies:** INF-003 (BullMQ), FEA-001 (notifications)

---

### DIF-010 — Multi-auth profile support per project 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Competitive (unique to Sentri)

**Problem:** Only single auth profile per project. Testing role-based access requires running same test suite multiple times with different credentials.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Named credential profiles per project (e.g., "admin", "viewer", "guest")
- ✅ Each profile has separate username/password or cookie payload
- ✅ `multi_role` Test Dial connected to profile selector
- ✅ Run can test against multiple profiles in parallel
- ✅ Per-profile audit trail of test results

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/utils/credentialEncryption.js` — multi-profile support
- `backend/src/routes/projects.js` — profile CRUD
- `backend/src/pipeline/stateExplorer.js` — accept `profileId`
- `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetail.jsx` — credential profiles panel

### DIF-012 — Multi-environment support (staging vs. production) 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Competitive

**Problem:** No concept of environments. Teams need to run same suite against `staging.myapp.com` and `myapp.com` separately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ `environments` table per project (name, baseUrl, credentials)
- ✅ Each run scoped to environment; separate run history per environment
- ✅ Dashboard shows per-environment pass rates

**Files Changed:**
- `backend/src/database/migrations/` — new `environments` table
- All run and project routes — environment scoping
- `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetail.jsx` — environment management
- `frontend/src/components/run/RunRegressionModal.jsx` — environment selector

**Dependencies:** ACL-001 (ensures environments are workspace-scoped)

## Phase 4 — Autonomous Intelligence

*Goal: Advance Sentri beyond triggered QA into a genuinely autonomous system. Items are postnoon Phase 3 completion and require stable APIs.*

---

### AUTO-001 — Intelligent test selection (risk-based run ordering) 🟢 Differentiator

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** L | **Source:** Competitive Gap Analysis

**Problem:** Runs all tests in insertion order. Autonomous system should prioritise: tests covering changed code, previously-failing tests, flaky tests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

---

### AUTO-019 — Run diffing: per-test comparison across runs 🔵 Medium

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Competitive Gap Analysis

**Problem:** Cannot compare two runs: "Run 42 had 3 new failures vs Run 41." Only shows trends, not per-test deltas.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ `GET /api/runs/diff?runA=<id>&runB=<id>` returns per-test delta
- ✅ Deltas: `newFailures`, `newPasses`, `unchanged`, `unstable`
- ✅ "Compare runs" button on Runs page

**Dependencies:** None

---

### AUTO-020 — Deployment platform integrations (Vercel, Netlify) 🔵 Medium

**Status:** 🔲 Planned | **Effort:** M | **Source:** Competitive Gap Analysis

**Problem:** Trigger endpoint is generic but no native integrations. Should auto-trigger on Vercel/Netlify deploys.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ Webhook handlers for Vercel (`X-Vercel-Signature`) and Netlify (`X-Netlify-Token`)
- ✅ Signature verification on all incoming webhooks
- ✅ Extract preview URL from payload; use as run baseUrl
