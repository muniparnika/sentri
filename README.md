## What is Sentri?

Sentri is an autonomous QA platform that removes the manual burden of writing and maintaining end-to-end tests. Point it at any web application and it will:

1. **Crawl** your app — mapping pages, forms, buttons, and interactive elements up to 3 levels deep
2. **Generate** meaningful Playwright test cases using your choice of AI provider (Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, or Ollama local models)
3. **Review** — all generated tests land in a **Draft** queue for human approval before they enter regression
4. **Execute** approved tests against your live app with one click, with per-step video, screenshots, network, and console capture
5. **Report** pass/fail results with live log streaming, browser view replays, and run history

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- An API key for at least one supported AI provider, **or** a local Ollama installation (see [AI Providers](#ai-providers))
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerised deployment)

---

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/RameshBabuPrudhvi/sentri.git
cd sentri

# 2. Configure environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env — add at least one AI provider key

# 3. Build and start
docker compose up --build

# Frontend → http://localhost:80
# Backend API → http://localhost:3001
```

---

### Option B: Local Development

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
cp .env.example .env        # Add at least one AI provider key
npm run dev                 # Starts on :3001
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                 # Starts on :3000, proxies /api to :3001
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## Usage

### 1. Configure an AI Provider

Go to **Settings** and paste in an API key for Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google — or configure **Ollama** for free local inference (no API key needed). The active provider is shown in the top-right badge. You can also set it in `backend/.env` before starting.

### 2. Create a Project

- Click **New Project**
- Enter your app name and URL (e.g. `https://myapp.com`)
- Use the **Test** button next to the URL field to verify the URL is reachable before saving
- URLs without a protocol are auto-prefixed with `https://` on blur
- Optionally configure login credentials (CSS selectors for username/password fields and their values) — all auth fields are required when auth is enabled, and toggling auth off preserves your entered values

### 3a. Crawl & Generate Tests (Automated)

- Open your project and click **Crawl & Generate Tests**
- Sentri visits your app, follows internal links, snapshots each page (including form structures, semantic sections, and heading hierarchy), and sends those snapshots through an 8-step pipeline:
  1. **Crawl** — discover pages up to 3 levels deep
  2. **Filter** — remove noise from interactive elements
  3. **Classify** — identify page intent (AUTH, CHECKOUT, SEARCH, etc.) with AI-assisted fallback for ambiguous pages
  4. **Generate** — two-phase PLAN → GENERATE pipeline produces focused Playwright tests per page
  5. **Deduplicate** — remove duplicate tests across the batch and existing project tests
  6. **Enhance** — strengthen assertions for better coverage
  7. **Validate** — reject malformed or placeholder tests before they enter the DB
  8. **Done** — store validated tests as Draft
- All generated tests appear in the **Generated Tests** tab as **Draft**

### 3b. Create a Test from Description (Manual)

- Click **Create Tests** from the Tests page
- Select your project (auto-populated), enter a test name and plain-English description
- AI generates detailed test steps and a Playwright script — review and edit the steps in a multi-phase wizard:
  - **Form** → describe what you want to test
  - **Generating** → AI analyses your description and writes steps + Playwright code
  - **Review** → edit, add, remove, or reorder steps before saving
  - **Done** → test saved as Draft
- The test is saved as **Draft** in your project's Generated Tests queue

### 4. Review & Approve Tests

- Open the **Generated Tests (Review Required)** tab in your project
- Use the **Approved / Draft / All Tests** toggle to filter by review status
- Inspect each Draft test — approve to promote it to Regression Suite, or reject to discard it
- Use **Approve All** / **Reject All** for bulk actions, or select individual tests

### 5. Edit Tests

- Open any test and click **Edit Test** to modify the name, description, steps, and priority
- Add, remove, or reorder steps inline
- On save, Playwright code is **automatically regenerated** from your updated steps via AI
- Export test data + run history as JSON from the test detail page

### 6. Run Regression

- Click **Run Regression** to execute all approved tests
- Tests run with **self-healing**: if a selector breaks, the runtime tries multiple fallback strategies (role, label, text, aria-label, title) and remembers which strategy won for future runs
- Watch live progress in the Run Detail view with per-step status
- Click any test case to drill into its **Step Results** — browser-chrome screenshot, network requests, console logs, and DOM snapshot
- After failures, an automatic **feedback loop** classifies each failure and auto-regenerates high-priority failing tests

### 7. Monitor

- The **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) shows aggregate pass rate, test counts, run history chart (shown with 1+ runs), and a first-time onboarding banner for new users
- The **Tests** page (`/tests`) provides a unified view of all tests across all projects with sortable columns, pagination (50/page), bulk select/approve/reject, keyboard shortcuts (`a`/`r`/`Esc`), and URL-synced filters (`?q=`, `?status=`, `?review=`)
- The **Projects** page (`/projects`) shows per-project health at a glance with pass rate bars and test counts
- The **Work** page (`/work`) lists all runs across all projects with search, status filters, type filters, and an inline **New Run** modal
- The **Reports** page (`/reports`) provides pass/fail trend charts, per-project breakdown, flaky test detection, and top failures with CSV export (disabled when no runs match the current filter)
- The **Context** page (`/context`) displays AI provider status and per-application environment details

## AI Providers

Sentri supports four AI providers for test generation. Auto-detection picks the first key that is set; you can force a specific provider with `AI_PROVIDER`.

| Provider | `AI_PROVIDER` value | Env Variable | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Claude | `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | gpt-4o-mini |
| Google Gemini | `google` | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | gemini-2.5-flash |
| Ollama (Local) | `local` | `AI_PROVIDER=local` | Configurable (default: `llama3.2`) |

**Auto-detection priority:** Anthropic → OpenAI → Google → Ollama (first key/config present wins).

You can also set or change keys at runtime from the **Settings** page without restarting the server.

### Ollama Setup

[Ollama](https://ollama.com) lets you run AI models locally — completely free and private.

1. Install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. Enable in Sentri via **Settings** UI or set `AI_PROVIDER=local` in `backend/.env`
4. Optionally configure `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL` (defaults: `http://localhost:11434` and `llama3.2`)

Ollama must be running on the same machine as the Sentri backend (or set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to a remote host).

## Test Lifecycle

All tests — whether crawled automatically or created manually — follow the same lifecycle:

```
Created (AI crawl or manual)
        │
        ▼
    [ Draft ]  ← default state for every new test
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   ▼         ▼
[Approved] [Rejected]
   │
   ▼
[Regression Suite]  ← only approved tests run here
   │
   ▼
[Run Results]  → passed / failed
```

- **Draft** — visible in the *Generated Tests* review tab; cannot be executed in regression
- **Approved** — promoted to the Regression Suite; included in every `Run Regression` execution
- **Rejected** — excluded from all runs; can be restored to Draft at any time
- Any test can be restored back to Draft using the Restore button or bulk action

---

## Self-Healing Test Runtime

Every test runs with an adaptive self-healing layer that makes tests resilient to UI changes:

1. **Multi-strategy element finding** — each `safeClick`, `safeFill`, and `safeExpect` call tries multiple selector strategies in a waterfall (role → label → text → aria-label → title)
2. **Healing history** — when a fallback strategy succeeds, the runtime records which strategy index won for that element. Future runs try the winning strategy first, reducing flakiness over time
3. **Transform engine** — AI-generated Playwright code is automatically rewritten at runtime to use self-healing helpers via regex-based transforms (e.g. `page.click('Sign in')` → `safeClick(page, 'Sign in')`)
4. **Feedback loop** — after test failures, the system classifies each failure (selector issue, navigation fail, etc.) and auto-regenerates high-priority failing tests via AI

### Runtime Defaults

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Element Timeout | 5000 ms | Max wait per element strategy in the waterfall |
| Retry Count | 3 | Retries per interaction (`safeClick` / `safeFill`) |
| Retry Delay | 400 ms | Pause between retries |
| Browser Mode | Headless | Chromium runs without a visible window |
| Viewport | 1280 × 720 | Default browser viewport size |

These values are compiled into the self-healing runtime. To customise, edit `backend/src/selfHealing.js`.

## Production Upgrades

Sentri is designed to grow. Recommended enhancements for production scale:

| Area | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Database** | Replace in-memory `db.js` with PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM |
| **Job Queue** | Add BullMQ + Redis for background crawl/run jobs with retries |
| **Auth** | Add user authentication (NextAuth, Clerk, or JWT middleware) |
| **File Storage** | Store videos and screenshots to S3/R2 instead of local disk |
| **Scheduling** | Add cron-based auto-runs via `node-cron` or a job scheduler |
| **Notifications** | Send Slack/email alerts on test failures |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Add workspace/organisation scoping to projects and tests |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Expose a run trigger webhook for GitHub Actions / GitLab CI |
