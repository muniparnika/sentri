## What is Sentri?

Sentri is an autonomous QA platform that removes the manual burden of writing and maintaining end-to-end tests. Point it at any web application and it will:

1. **Crawl** your app — mapping pages, forms, buttons, and interactive elements up to 3 levels deep
2. **Generate** meaningful Playwright test cases using your choice of AI provider (Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, or Ollama local models)
3. **Review** — all generated tests land in a **Draft** queue for human approval before they enter regression
4. **Execute** approved tests against your live app with one click, with per-step video, screenshots, network, and console capture
5. **Stream** real-time results via SSE — live browser view, LLM token streaming, execution timeline, and instant status updates
6. **Report** pass/fail results with browser view replays, run history, and code diffs

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| 🕷️ **Autonomous Crawler** | Explores your app up to 3 levels deep, mapping all pages and interactive elements |
| 🤖 **Multi-AI Test Generation** | Anthropic Claude Sonnet, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash, OpenAI GPT-4o-mini, or Ollama local models — switch with one env var |
| 🦙 **Ollama (Local Models)** | Run models locally with Ollama — completely free and private, no API key needed. NDJSON response fallback, `OLLAMA_MAX_PREDICT` token cap, and HTTP 500 retry for robust local inference |
| ✦ **Create Test from Description** | Describe a scenario in plain English; AI generates steps + a Playwright script in seconds |
| 🎛️ **Test Dials** | Configurable AI generation: pick strategy (happy path, edge cases, comprehensive…), workflow perspective, quality checks, output format, test count, and language. Presets like "Smoke Test" and "BDD Blueprint" auto-fill multiple dials. Config is validated server-side to prevent prompt injection |
| ⛔ **Abort / Cancel** | Stop any running crawl, generation, or test run via the UI or `POST /api/runs/:id/abort`. `AbortSignal` is threaded through the entire pipeline so AI calls, browser operations, and feedback loops halt immediately |
| 🆔 **Human-Readable IDs** | Sequential IDs (`TC-1`, `RUN-2`, `PRJ-3`, `ACT-4`) replace UUIDs — easier to reference in conversations and bug reports. Counters persist in the DB and rehydrate on startup |
| 🧬 **Self-Healing Tests** | Multi-strategy element finding with adaptive healing history — tests auto-recover when selectors change. Visualised with a **Healing Timeline** showing the fallback chain |
| 🔄 **Two-Phase AI Pipeline** | PLAN → GENERATE split avoids token truncation; AI-assisted intent classification for ambiguous pages |
| 📡 **Real-Time SSE Streaming** | Server-Sent Events replace polling — live log, result, frame, and LLM token events pushed to the browser with automatic reconnection and exponential backoff |
| 🖥️ **Live Browser View** | CDP screencast frames streamed at ~7 FPS and rendered on a `<canvas>` during test execution |
| 🧠 **LLM Token Streaming** | Watch AI output arrive token-by-token in a collapsible panel with raw/JSON preview modes |
| 📋 **Draft → Review → Regression** | All tests (crawled or manually created) start as Draft. Approve to promote to Regression Suite |
| ✏️ **Inline Test Editing** | Edit test steps, name, description, and priority in the UI — Playwright code auto-regenerates on save |
| 🔀 **Code Diff View** | Built-in Myers line diff shows what changed when Playwright code is regenerated |
| ▶️ **One-Click Regression Run** | Execute all approved tests with video recording, screenshots, network logs, and DOM snapshots |
| 🎥 **Step Results View** | Per-test-case drill-down with **OverlayCanvas** bounding-box highlights on screenshots and step-by-step status |
| 📈 **Execution Timeline** | Gantt-style chart showing each test's start time and duration for at-a-glance run performance |
| 🗺️ **Site Graph** | D3 force-directed graph of crawled pages with live node status, edge inference, and a "+ Generate test" action per page |
| 🔑 **Auth Support** | Login to your app before crawling using CSS selectors for username/password fields |
| ⚙️ **Runtime API Key Config** | Set or change your AI provider key in the Settings UI — no server restart needed |
| 📊 **Rich Dashboard** | Pass rate, defect category breakdown, flaky test detection, test growth sparkline, MTTR, run status distribution, test review pipeline, and auto-fix / self-healing stats |
| 📝 **Activity Log** | Complete timeline of all user and system actions — crawls, runs, edits, approvals, aborts |
| ⚡ **Async Test Generation** | `POST /projects/:id/tests/generate` returns `202 { runId }` immediately; the AI pipeline runs in the background |
| 🔗 **API Resilience** | `AbortController`-based timeouts (30s default, 5min for long ops), connection testing, and API key validation endpoints |
| 📦 **Data Caching** | `useProjectData` hook with module-level 30s TTL cache + batch `/api/tests` endpoint to eliminate N+1 fetches |
| 🪵 **Centralized Logging** | Env-driven log level, timestamp format, timezone, and optional JSON-lines mode (`LOG_LEVEL`, `LOG_DATE_FORMAT`, `LOG_TIMEZONE`, `LOG_JSON`) |
| 🌙 **Dark Mode** | Automatic dark mode via `prefers-color-scheme` — all UI components adapt seamlessly |
| ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts** | `a` approve, `r` reject, `/` search, `Esc` clear — speed up test review workflows |
| 🔍 **Global Test Search** | Search across all tests from the sidebar; results open the `/tests` page with URL-synced filters |
| 📄 **Pagination & Sorting** | Tests page and project review tab paginate at 50/page with sortable columns and URL-synced filters |
| ☑️ **Bulk Actions** | Select multiple tests for bulk approve/reject/delete with confirmation modal for "select all" operations |
| 🔔 **Browser Notifications** | Optional desktop notifications when a run completes, with favicon badge (⏳/✅/❌) while running |
| 🗑️ **Project Deletion** | Cascade-delete a project and all its tests, runs, and activities — with an active-run guard to prevent orphaned data |
| 🛡️ **Error Boundary & 404** | Graceful crash recovery and a proper 404 page for unknown routes |
| 🐳 **Docker Ready** | Full Docker Compose setup for instant deployment |

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- An API key for at least one supported AI provider, **or** a local Ollama installation (see [AI Providers](#ai-providers))
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerised deployment)

---

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/RameshBabuPrudhvi/sentri.git
cd sentri

# 2. Configure environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env — add at least one AI provider key

# 3. Build and start
docker compose up --build

# Frontend → http://localhost:80
# Backend API → http://localhost:3001
```

---

### Option B: Local Development

**Backend:**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
cp .env.example .env        # Add at least one AI provider key
npm run dev                 # Starts on :3001
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                 # Starts on :3000, proxies /api to :3001
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## Usage

### 1. Configure an AI Provider

Go to **Settings** and paste in an API key for Anthropic, OpenAI, or Google — or configure **Ollama** for free local inference (no API key needed). The active provider is shown in the top-right badge. You can also set it in `backend/.env` before starting.

### 2. Create a Project

- Click **New Project**
- Enter your app name and URL (e.g. `https://myapp.com`)
- Use the **Test** button next to the URL field to verify the URL is reachable before saving
- URLs without a protocol are auto-prefixed with `https://` on blur
- Optionally configure login credentials (CSS selectors for username/password fields and their values) — all auth fields are required when auth is enabled, and toggling auth off preserves your entered values

### 3a. Crawl & Generate Tests (Automated)

- Open your project and click **Crawl & Generate Tests**
- Optionally expand the **Test Dials** panel to configure strategy, test count, workflow perspective, quality checks, output format, and language before starting
- Sentri visits your app, follows internal links, snapshots each page (including form structures, semantic sections, and heading hierarchy), and sends those snapshots through an 8-step pipeline:
  1. **Crawl** — discover pages up to 3 levels deep
  2. **Filter** — remove noise from interactive elements
  3. **Classify** — identify page intent (AUTH, CHECKOUT, SEARCH, etc.) with AI-assisted fallback for ambiguous pages
  4. **Generate** — two-phase PLAN → GENERATE pipeline produces focused Playwright tests per page
  5. **Deduplicate** — remove duplicate tests across the batch and existing project tests
  6. **Enhance** — strengthen assertions for better coverage
  7. **Validate** — reject malformed or placeholder tests before they enter the DB
  8. **Done** — store validated tests as Draft
- Watch crawl progress live in the **Site Graph** — a D3 force-directed map of discovered pages with status indicators
- Click **Stop** at any time to abort the crawl — all in-progress AI calls and browser operations are cancelled immediately
- All generated tests appear in the **Generated Tests** tab as **Draft**

### 3b. Create a Test from Description (Manual)

- Click **Create Tests** from the Tests page — opens the **Generate Test Modal** with two tabs:
  - **Story** — select your project, enter a test name and plain-English description
  - **Test Dials** — configure AI generation behaviour (strategy, test count, format, etc.)
- AI generates detailed test steps and a Playwright script. Watch output arrive token-by-token in the **LLM Stream Panel**
- The test is saved as **Draft** in your project's Generated Tests queue

### 4. Review & Approve Tests

- Open the **Generated Tests (Review Required)** tab in your project
- Use the **Approved / Draft / All Tests** toggle to filter by review status
- Inspect each Draft test — approve to promote it to Regression Suite, or reject to discard it
- Use **Approve All** / **Reject All** for bulk actions, or select individual tests

### 5. Edit Tests

- Open any test and click **Edit Test** to modify the name, description, steps, and priority
- Add, remove, or reorder steps inline
- On save, Playwright code is **automatically regenerated** from your updated steps via AI
- Click **Show changes** to view a **Code Diff** (Myers line diff) of the previous vs. current Playwright code
- Export test data + run history as CSV from the test detail page

### 6. Run Regression

- Click **Run Regression** to execute all approved tests
- Tests run with **self-healing**: if a selector breaks, the runtime tries multiple fallback strategies (role, label, text, aria-label, title) and remembers which strategy won for future runs
- Watch live progress via **SSE streaming** — no more polling. The Run Detail view updates in real time with logs, results, and a **live browser view** (CDP screencast at ~7 FPS)
- Click **Stop Task** at any time to abort the run — remaining tests are skipped and the run is marked as "aborted"
- The **Execution Timeline** (Gantt chart) shows each test's start time and duration
- Click any test case to drill into its **Step Results** — **OverlayCanvas** draws bounding boxes on screenshots, plus network requests, console logs, and DOM snapshot
- The **Healing Timeline** visualises which selector strategies were tried and which one won
- After failures, an automatic **feedback loop** classifies each failure and auto-regenerates high-priority failing tests
- A post-run **Outcome Banner** offers "Review Tests" and "Re-run Tests" actions

### 7. Monitor

- The **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) shows pass rate, defect category breakdown (selector / navigation / timeout / assertion), flaky test count, test growth sparkline, MTTR, run status distribution, test review pipeline, auto-fix and self-healing stats, and recent activity
- The **Tests** page (`/tests`) provides a unified view of all tests across all projects with sortable columns, pagination (50/page), bulk select/approve/reject, keyboard shortcuts (`a`/`r`/`Esc`), and URL-synced filters (`?q=`, `?status=`, `?review=`)
- The **Projects** page (`/projects`) shows per-project health at a glance with pass rate bars, test counts, and a delete button with cascade confirmation
- The **Runs** page (`/work`) lists all runs across all projects with search, status filters (including "aborted"), type filters, and an inline **New Run** modal
- The **Reports** page (`/reports`) provides pass/fail trend charts, per-project breakdown, flaky test detection, and top failures with CSV export (disabled when no runs match the current filter)
- The **System** page (`/context`) displays AI provider status and per-application environment details

## AI Providers

Sentri supports four AI providers for test generation. Auto-detection picks the first key that is set; you can force a specific provider with `AI_PROVIDER`.

| Provider | `AI_PROVIDER` value | Env Variable | Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Claude | `anthropic` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 |
| OpenAI | `openai` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | gpt-4o-mini |
| Google Gemini | `google` | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | gemini-2.5-flash |
| Ollama (Local) | `local` | `AI_PROVIDER=local` | Configurable (default: `llama3.2`) |

**Auto-detection priority:** Anthropic → OpenAI → Google → Ollama (first key/config present wins).

You can also set or change keys at runtime from the **Settings** page without restarting the server.

### Ollama Setup

[Ollama](https://ollama.com) lets you run AI models locally — completely free and private.

1. Install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. Enable in Sentri via **Settings** UI or set `AI_PROVIDER=local` in `backend/.env`
4. Optionally configure `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` and `OLLAMA_MODEL` (defaults: `http://localhost:11434` and `llama3.2`)

Ollama must be running on the same machine as the Sentri backend (or set `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` to a remote host).

## Test Lifecycle

All tests — whether crawled automatically or created manually — follow the same lifecycle:

```
Created (AI crawl or manual)
        │
        ▼
    [ Draft ]  ← default state for every new test
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   ▼         ▼
[Approved] [Rejected]
   │
   ▼
[Regression Suite]  ← only approved tests run here
   │
   ▼
[Run Results]  → passed / failed
```

- **Draft** — visible in the *Generated Tests* review tab; cannot be executed in regression
- **Approved** — promoted to the Regression Suite; included in every `Run Regression` execution
- **Rejected** — excluded from all runs; can be restored to Draft at any time
- Any test can be restored back to Draft using the Restore button or bulk action

## Self-Healing Test Runtime

Every test runs with an adaptive self-healing layer that makes tests resilient to UI changes:

1. **Multi-strategy element finding** — each `safeClick`, `safeFill`, and `safeExpect` call tries multiple selector strategies in a waterfall (role → label → text → aria-label → title)
2. **Healing history** — when a fallback strategy succeeds, the runtime records which strategy index won for that element. Future runs try the winning strategy first, reducing flakiness over time
3. **Transform engine** — AI-generated Playwright code is automatically rewritten at runtime to use self-healing helpers via regex-based transforms (e.g. `page.click('Sign in')` → `safeClick(page, 'Sign in')`)
4. **Feedback loop** — after test failures, the system classifies each failure (selector issue, navigation fail, etc.) and auto-regenerates high-priority failing tests via AI

### Runtime Defaults

| Setting | Value | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Element Timeout | 5000 ms | Max wait per element strategy in the waterfall |
| Retry Count | 3 | Retries per interaction (`safeClick` / `safeFill`) |
| Retry Delay | 400 ms | Pause between retries |
| Browser Mode | Headless | Chromium runs without a visible window |
| Viewport | 1280 × 720 | Default browser viewport size |

These values are compiled into the self-healing runtime. To customise, edit `backend/src/selfHealing.js`.

## Production Upgrades

Sentri is designed to grow. Recommended enhancements for production scale:

| Area | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Database** | Replace in-memory `db.js` with PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM |
| **Job Queue** | Add BullMQ + Redis for background crawl/run jobs with retries |
| **Auth** | Add user authentication (NextAuth, Clerk, or JWT middleware) |
| **File Storage** | Store videos and screenshots to S3/R2 instead of local disk |
| **Scheduling** | Add cron-based auto-runs via `node-cron` or a job scheduler |
| **Notifications** | Send Slack/email alerts on test failures |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Add workspace/organisation scoping to projects and tests |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Expose a run trigger webhook for GitHub Actions / GitLab CI |
