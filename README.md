## Why Sentri?

There are plenty of "AI test generator" repos. Most generate code and leave you to figure out the rest. Sentri is different — it's the **full lifecycle**: crawl → generate → review → execute → heal → report, in one tool.

| Problem | How Sentri solves it |
|---|---|
| Writing E2E tests is slow | Point it at a URL — tests are generated in minutes, not days |
| Selectors break every sprint | Self-healing runtime tries role → label → text → aria-label → title, **remembers** what worked, and tries that first next time |
| AI-generated tests are untrustworthy | Every test lands in a **Draft** queue. Nothing executes until a human approves it |
| You can't see what the test is doing | Live browser screencast, real-time SSE log stream, per-step screenshots with bounding-box overlays |
| Tests fail and nobody knows why | AI feedback loop classifies every failure (selector / timeout / assertion / navigation) and auto-regenerates the worst offenders |
| Vendor lock-in on AI providers | Swap between Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or **Ollama (free, local, private)** with one setting — no code changes |
| Generated tests are shallow | 8-stage pipeline: classify page intent → plan → generate → deduplicate → enhance assertions → validate — not just "write a test for this HTML" |

---

## How It Works

1. **Crawl** — Chromium explores your app, maps pages with a live D3 site graph
2. **Generate** — 8-stage AI pipeline: crawl → filter → classify → plan → generate → deduplicate → enhance → validate
3. **Describe** — or skip crawling — write a plain-English scenario and AI generates the test
4. **Review** — every test lands in Draft. Approve/reject with keyboard shortcuts before anything runs
5. **Execute** — one-click regression with live browser view, SSE log stream, and per-step screenshots
6. **Self-heal** — multi-strategy selector waterfall that remembers what worked per element
7. **Monitor** — dashboard with pass rate, defect breakdown, flaky detection, MTTR, and growth trends

## Key Features

| Feature | What it actually does |
|---|---|
| 🧬 **Adaptive Self-Healing** | Not just "retry with a different selector" — records which strategy won per element and tries it first next run. Tests get more resilient over time |
| 🎛️ **Test Dials** | 6 strategies × 5 workflows × 8 quality checks × 3 formats × 8 languages. Presets auto-fill. Config validated server-side to block prompt injection |
| 🔄 **Two-Phase AI Pipeline** | PLAN → GENERATE split avoids token truncation. Intent classification (AUTH/CHECKOUT/SEARCH/CRUD/NAVIGATION/CONTENT) focuses each prompt |
| 📡 **Real-Time SSE** | No polling. Server-Sent Events push log, result, frame, and LLM token events to the browser with auto-reconnect and exponential backoff |
| 🖥️ **Live Browser View** | CDP screencast at ~7 FPS rendered on a `<canvas>` — watch the browser do what your test does |
| 🧠 **LLM Token Streaming** | Watch AI output arrive token-by-token in a collapsible panel with raw/JSON preview modes |
| 🗺️ **Site Graph** | D3 force-directed graph of crawled pages with live node status, edge inference, and colour-coded state |
| 🆔 **Human-Readable IDs** | `TC-1`, `RUN-2`, `PRJ-3` — not UUIDs. Counters persist in DB and rehydrate on startup |
| ⛔ **Abort Everything** | `AbortSignal` threaded through the entire pipeline — AI calls, browser ops, and feedback loops halt immediately |
| 🔀 **Code Diff View** | Built-in Myers line diff shows what changed when Playwright code is regenerated |
| 📦 **Smart Data Fetching** | `useProjectData` hook with 30s TTL cache + batch `/api/tests` endpoint eliminates N+1 fetches |
| 🦙 **Ollama Support** | Completely free, private, local inference. NDJSON response fallback, `OLLAMA_MAX_PREDICT` token cap, HTTP 500 retry |
| 🔐 **Built-in Auth** | Email/password + GitHub/Google OAuth. Scrypt hashing, JWT with HS256, rate limiting, CSRF protection |
| 📖 **Full Documentation** | VitePress guide, REST API reference, and auto-generated JSDoc — all deployed to GitHub Pages |
| 🌙 **Dark Mode** | Automatic via `prefers-color-scheme` — all UI components adapt |
| 🐳 **Docker Ready** | `docker compose up --build` and you're running. GitHub Pages + Render deployment supported |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- An API key for at least one AI provider — **or** a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) installation (free, no key needed)
- Docker & Docker Compose (optional, for containerised deployment)

---

### Option A: Docker (Recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RameshBabuPrudhvi/sentri.git
cd sentri

cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env — add at least one AI provider key

docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80)

---

### Option B: Local Development

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
cp .env.example .env        # Add at least one AI provider key
npm run dev                 # Starts on :3001
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                 # Starts on :3000, proxies /api to :3001
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## AI Providers

| Provider | Env Variable | Model |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Claude | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 |
| OpenAI | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | gpt-4o-mini |
| Google Gemini | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` | gemini-2.5-flash |
| Ollama (local, free) | `AI_PROVIDER=local` | llama3.2 (configurable) |

Auto-detects in order: Anthropic → OpenAI → Google → Ollama. Switch at any time from the Settings page.

> 📖 Full provider setup guide including Ollama: **[AI Providers →](https://rameshbabuprudhvi.github.io/sentri/docs/guide/ai-providers.html)**

## Documentation

Sentri ships with three layers of documentation:

| Layer | URL | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Guide & API Reference** | [/sentri/docs/](https://rameshbabuprudhvi.github.io/sentri/docs/) | VitePress — `docs/` directory |
| **Code Docs (JSDoc)** | [/sentri/docs/jsdoc/](https://rameshbabuprudhvi.github.io/sentri/docs/jsdoc/) | Auto-generated from source code |
| **README** | This file | `README.md` |

### Running docs locally

```bash
# VitePress guide
cd docs && npm install && npm run dev

# JSDoc code docs
cd backend && npm run docs && open docs-api/index.html
```

### Adding JSDoc to remaining files

A script is included to add `@module` headers to any files that don't have one yet:

```bash
bash scripts/add-jsdoc-modules.sh
```

The CI pipeline auto-generates JSDoc and deploys it alongside the VitePress site on every push to `main`.

---

## Deployment

### GitHub Pages + Render

Deploy the frontend to GitHub Pages (free) and the backend to Render (free tier available):

```bash
# Frontend build for GitHub Pages
cd frontend
GITHUB_PAGES=true VITE_API_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com npm run build
```

Set on Render: `NODE_ENV=production`, `JWT_SECRET=<openssl rand -base64 48>`, plus your AI provider key.

See the [full deployment guide](https://rameshbabuprudhvi.github.io/sentri/docs/guide/github-pages-render.html) for details.
