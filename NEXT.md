## ▶ Current PR — AUTO-016b

**Title:** Frontend CrawlView accessibility violation panel
**Branch:** `feat/AUTO-016b-a11y-panel`
**Effort:** S | **Priority:** 🟡 High
**All dependencies:** ✅ AUTO-016 (PR #121)

### What to build

Backend half of AUTO-016 shipped in PR #121 (axe-core scan + persistence + per-page summary on `run.pages[].accessibilityViolations`). This item adds the human-scope UI: a per-page accessibility panel in `frontend/src/components/crawl/CrawlView.jsx` showing severity + WCAG criterion + collapsed node-list, plus a "Top accessibility offenders" rollup on the dashboard.

### Files to change

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `frontend/src/components/crawl/CrawlView.jsx` | Per-page a11y panel (severity, WCAG criterion, node list) |
| `frontend/src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` | "Top accessibility offenders" rollup card |
| `backend/src/routes/dashboard.js` | A11y rollup field on dashboard summary |
| optional: new `GET /api/v1/runs/:id/accessibility` | Backed by `accessibilityViolationRepo.getByRunId()` |

### PR checklist

- [ ] Update `AUTO-016b` status in `ROADMAP.md` to ✅ Complete with PR number
- [ ] Update this file: move AUTO-016b to "Recently completed", promote next item from Queue
- [ ] Add entry to `docs/changelog.md` under `## [Unreleased]`

## ⏭ Queue (next 3 PRs after current)

### 2 · AUTO-012 — SLA / quality gate enforcement
**Effort:** M | **Priority:** 🟡 High | **Dependencies:** none

Per-project `qualityGates` config (min pass rate, max flaky %, max failures). On run completion, evaluate gates and include `{ passed, violations[] }` in both the trigger response and run result. GitHub Action exit code reflects gate status.

**Files:** `backend/src/routes/projects.js` · `backend/src/testRunner.js` · `backend/src/routes/trigger.js` · `frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetail.jsx`

### 3 · DIF-015b Gap 2 — Recorder selectorGenerator: data-testid quality scoring
**Effort:** S | **Priority:** 🔵 Medium | **Dependencies:** none

Score data-testid candidates in the recorder's `selectorGenerator()` priority chain so generic / auto-generated ids (e.g. `data-testid="btn-1"`, hash-suffixed values) are demoted in favour of stable semantic ids. Highest-value next step toward flipping DIF-015b to ✅ Complete in `ROADMAP.md` once Gap 3 also ships. Heuristics + acceptance criteria documented in `ROADMAP.md § DIF-015b`.

**Files:** `backend/src/runner/recorder.js` (only)

### 4 · AUTO-017 — Performance budget testing (Web Vitals)
**Effort:** M | **Priority:** 🔵 Medium | **Dependencies:** none

Capture Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, INP, TTFB) per page during runs and compare against per-project budgets. Surface budget violations as a new run-result section and gate runs when budgets are exceeded.

**Files:** `backend/src/runner/pageCapture.js` · `backend/src/testRunner.js` · `frontend/src/components/run/StepResultsView.jsx`

## 🔀 Parallel opportunities (small items, no queue conflicts)

These can be picked up by a second engineer alongside the current PR without file conflicts:

| ID | Title | Effort | Shared files? |
|----|-------|--------|---------------|
| **DIF-015b Gap 2** | **Recorder selectorGenerator: data-testid quality scoring** | **S** | **`backend/src/runner/recorder.js` only — no overlap with AUTO-016 / MNT-006 / AUTO-012** |
| DIF-015b Gap 3 | Recorder selectorGenerator: iframe + shadow-DOM traversal | M | `backend/src/runner/recorder.js` only |
| AUTO-017 | Performance budget testing (Web Vitals) | M | None |
| AUTO-019 | Run diffing: per-test comparison across runs | M | None |

> **DIF-015b follow-up priority:** Gap 2 (data-testid scoring) is the highest-value next step — it's a small, contained edit to the priority chain in `selectorGenerator()` and unblocks DIF-015b flipping to ✅ Complete in ROADMAP.md once Gap 3 also ships. Both gaps are documented in `ROADMAP.md` § DIF-015b with concrete heuristics, files-to-change, and acceptance criteria. Pick Gap 2 next; defer Gap 3 to a separate PR (different effort tier).
>
> Why these aren't promoted to "Current PR" yet: AUTO-016 (axe-core) is the queued sprint item with a higher priority label (🟡 High) than DIF-015b sub-items (🔵 Medium). The recorder gaps are tracked here so they don't get lost — pick them up alongside AUTO-016 if a second agent has bandwidth.
