# API Reference

The Sentri backend exposes a RESTful JSON API on port `3001` by default.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:3001/api`

## Authentication

Protected endpoints use **HttpOnly cookie-based auth**. After signing in via [`POST /api/auth/login`](/api/auth) or an OAuth callback, the server sets an `access_token` cookie that the browser sends automatically on every request.

All mutating requests (POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE) must also include the CSRF token in the `X-CSRF-Token` header (read from the `_csrf` cookie).

For direct API consumers (scripts, CI), a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header is still accepted as a fallback:

```
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

## Endpoints

| Section | Description |
|---|---|
| [Projects](/api/projects) | Create, list, get, delete projects |
| [Tests](/api/tests) | CRUD, generate, review (approve/reject/restore), bulk actions |
| [Runs](/api/runs) | Execute tests, get results, SSE event stream, abort |
| [Settings](/api/settings) | AI provider config, Ollama status, system info |
| [Authentication](/api/auth) | Register, sign in, OAuth (GitHub/Google), token management |

## Common Patterns

### Error Responses

All errors return JSON with an `error` field:

```json
{ "error": "Invalid email or password." }
```

### Rate Limiting

The sign-in endpoint is rate-limited to **10 attempts per IP per 15 minutes**. When exceeded:

```
HTTP 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: <seconds>
```

### SSE Event Stream

Run events are streamed via Server-Sent Events at `GET /api/runs/:runId/events`. Event types:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| `log` | Real-time log message |
| `result` | Per-test pass/fail result |
| `snapshot` | Full run state — emitted after each result for real-time progress during parallel execution |
| `frame` | CDP screencast frame (base64 JPEG) |
| `done` | Run completed — includes final status |
