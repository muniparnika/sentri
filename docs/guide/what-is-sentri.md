# What is Sentri?

Sentri is an **autonomous QA platform** that crawls your web app, generates Playwright test suites using AI, and self-heals them when your UI changes.

## The Problem

| Problem | How Sentri solves it |
|---|---|
| Writing E2E tests is slow | Point it at a URL — tests are generated in minutes, not days |
| Selectors break every sprint | Self-healing runtime tries multiple strategies, **remembers** what worked |
| AI-generated tests are untrustworthy | Every test lands in a **Draft** queue. Nothing executes until a human approves |
| You can't see what the test is doing | Live browser screencast, real-time log stream, per-step screenshots |
| Tests fail and nobody knows why | AI classifies every failure and auto-regenerates the worst offenders |
| Vendor lock-in on AI providers | Swap between Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, or Ollama with one setting |

## How It Works

### 1. Crawl
Sentri launches a real Chromium browser and explores your app — following links, mapping forms, buttons, and interactive elements. A D3 force-directed Site Graph shows discovered pages in real time.

### 2. Generate
Each page goes through an 8-stage AI pipeline: crawl → filter → classify → plan → generate → deduplicate → enhance → validate. All tests land in a Draft queue.

### 3. Review
Approve or reject tests one by one or in bulk. Only approved tests execute in regression.

### 4. Execute
One-click regression with live browser view (CDP screencast), SSE log stream, execution timeline, and per-step screenshots with bounding-box overlays.

### 5. Self-Heal
When a selector fails, the self-healing layer tries fallback strategies in a waterfall. When a fallback wins, it records which strategy succeeded — and tries it first next time.

### 6. Monitor
Dashboard with pass rate, defect categories, flaky test detection, test growth sparkline, and self-healing stats.
