/**
 * @module middleware/workspaceScope
 * @description Middleware that resolves the authenticated user's workspace
 * and role, injecting `req.workspaceId` and `req.userRole` on every request.
 *
 * Must run AFTER `requireAuth` (which sets `req.authUser`).
 *
 * ### Resolution strategy
 * The JWT contains `workspaceId` as a hint for which workspace the user last
 * used.  The **role is always resolved from the database** so that permission
 * changes (promote / demote / remove) take effect immediately — not after the
 * JWT expires.  This follows the Slack / GitHub model: identity in the token,
 * authorization from the DB.
 *
 * If the user has no workspace membership at all, returns 403.
 *
 * @example
 * import { workspaceScope } from "../middleware/workspaceScope.js";
 * app.use("/api/projects", requireAuth, workspaceScope, projectsRouter);
 */

/**
 * Express middleware that injects workspace context onto the request.

 * Sets:
 * - `req.workspaceId` — The active workspace ID.
 * - `req.userRole`    — The user's role in that workspace ('admin' | 'qa_lead' | 'viewer').
