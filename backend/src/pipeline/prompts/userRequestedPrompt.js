  return `You are a senior QA engineer. A user has asked you to create a specific Playwright test.

TEST NAME: ${name}
USER DESCRIPTION: ${description || "(no description provided)"}
APPLICATION URL: ${appUrl}

Your job is to generate test(s) that precisely match the user's request above.
Do NOT generate generic tests. Do NOT generate tests unrelated to the title and description.
The test(s) MUST directly verify what the user described — nothing more, nothing less.

STRICT RULES:
1. ${countInstruction} — focused entirely on what the user described
2. The test name should match or closely reflect the user's provided name
3. Steps must be specific to the described scenario, not generic page checks
4. ${SELF_HEALING_PROMPT_RULES}
5. Every test MUST have at least 2 strong assertions
6. STRONG assertions: toHaveURL(), toBeVisible(), toContainText(), toHaveValue(), toBeEnabled()
7. WEAK (forbidden): toBeTruthy(), toBeDefined(), toEqual(true)
8. CRITICAL: playwrightCode MUST start with: await page.goto('${appUrl}', { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded', timeout: 30000 });
9. CRITICAL: playwrightCode must be fully self-contained and executable on its own
10. CRITICAL: Do NOT use placeholder URLs like 'https://example.com' — use '${appUrl}'
11. STABILITY: For URL assertions use regex patterns — e.g. await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/about/i) instead of exact URL strings, because query params, trailing slashes, and redirects cause false failures
12. STABILITY: After every page.goto() use { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' } — NEVER use waitForLoadState('networkidle'). After clicking something that navigates, use await Promise.all([page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded', timeout: 30000 }), element.click()]). For dynamic content assertions use await page.waitForSelector('selector', { timeout: 15000 }) before expect().

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code fences):
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "${name}",
      "description": "${(description || "").replace(/"/g, '\\"').slice(0, 200)}",
      "priority": "high",
      "type": "user-requested",
      "scenario": "positive",
      "steps": ["User navigates to the application", "User performs the described action", "Assert: expected outcome is verified"],
      "playwrightCode": "import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\\n\\ntest('${name.replace(/'/g, "\\'")}', async ({ page }) => {\\n  // complete test code\\n});"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT: The "steps" array must contain SHORT HUMAN-READABLE descriptions of what the user does (plain English), NOT Playwright code. Playwright code goes ONLY in "playwrightCode".
BAD steps:  ["await page.goto('...')", "await page.click('.btn')"]
GOOD steps: ["User opens the homepage", "User clicks the Sign In button"]`;
