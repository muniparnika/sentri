/**
 * outputSchema.js — Single source of truth for the AI-generated test JSON schema
 *
 * Previously the JSON output format, type enum, step-writing rules, and assertion
 * rules were duplicated across intentPrompt.js, journeyPrompt.js, and
 * userRequestedPrompt.js. Changes had to be applied in 3 places, and they
 * frequently drifted.
 *
 * This module exports:
 *   VALID_TEST_TYPES     — enum array for the "type" field
 *   OUTPUT_SCHEMA_BLOCK  — the JSON schema example + type/step/assertion rules
 *   buildSystemPrompt()  — the persona + rules that belong in the "system" role
 *
 * Prompt builders import these and only supply the user-facing context
 * (page data, scenario hints, dials) in the "user" role.

export const ASSERTION_RULES = `
- Every test MUST have at least 2 strong assertions that verify SPECIFIC VISIBLE CONTENT on the page (exact text, element count, field value) — not just that "a page loaded" or "an element exists".
- STRONG assertions (preferred): toBeVisible() on elements found by specific text/role, toContainText('exact text'), toHaveValue('specific value'), toBeEnabled(), toHaveCount(N). Use toHaveURL() ONLY with a loose hostname-only regex (see STABILITY rule) — never with path or query patterns.
- WEAK (forbidden): toBeTruthy(), toBeDefined(), toEqual(true).
- In "playwrightCode", every expect() assertion must check something a user can SEE — a specific heading, a button label, form field content, a list item count, an error message, or a visible text string. Do NOT write assertions that only check "page loaded" or "element exists" without verifying its text or state.`.trim();

export const STABILITY_RULES = `
- URL ASSERTIONS: NEVER assert exact URLs or narrow regex patterns on the final URL after navigation. Real-world sites redirect unpredictably (CAPTCHAs, consent pages, geo-redirects, login walls, URL-encoded params). Instead: (a) PREFER asserting visible page CONTENT over toHaveURL(). (b) If you must check the URL, use the LOOSEST possible regex that only checks the hostname — e.g. await expect(page).toHaveURL(/example\\.com/i) — never match on path segments or query params. (c) For search flows, assert that results appeared on the page rather than checking the URL. (d) NEVER use toHaveURL() with a literal string — it will fail on any redirect, query param, or geo-variant of the URL. (e) NEVER add toHaveURL() as a final assertion after a search, filter, or form action — the URL will contain query params that make an exact match impossible.
- After every page.goto() use { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' } — NEVER use waitForLoadState('networkidle') as SPAs and e-commerce sites continuously fire background requests and never reach networkidle, causing a guaranteed 30s timeout. After clicking a button or link that causes navigation, use await Promise.all([page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded', timeout: 30000 }), element.click()]). For asserting dynamic content, use await page.waitForSelector('selector', { timeout: 15000 }) before the expect() assertion.`.trim();

FIELD RULES:
- "type" must be one of: ${VALID_TEST_TYPES.map(t => `"${t}"`).join(", ")}. Pick the best match. If unsure, use "functional".
- "preconditions" — state any required setup (user role, data state, browser context). Omit or set to "" if the test starts from a clean state.
- "testData" — provide concrete sample values (emails, IDs, search terms, amounts) for documentation only. CRITICAL: ALL values in testData MUST be inlined as string or number literals directly inside playwrightCode — NEVER declare a variable (const searchTerm = ...) and NEVER reference a testData key by name inside the code. BAD: safeFill(page, 'Search', searchTerm) — searchTerm is not defined at runtime. GOOD: safeFill(page, 'Search', 'iphone') — literal value inline. Omit testData or set to {} if no test data is needed.
- "steps" — SHORT HUMAN-READABLE descriptions of what the user does and sees (plain English), NOT Playwright code or technical assertions. Playwright code goes ONLY in "playwrightCode".
  Write each step so a manual tester can follow it without looking at code. Name the SPECIFIC element or text the user interacts with and what they should SEE as a result.
  BAD steps (too vague):  ["The page loads successfully", "The URL reflects the section", "Verify the expected content is displayed"]
  GOOD steps (specific):  ["User sees the heading 'Create Account' and a form with Name, Email, and Password fields", "User fills in Name with 'Jane' and Email with 'jane@test.com' and clicks 'Sign Up'", "A confirmation message 'Account created' appears below the form"]
  When the output format is Gherkin / BDD, write steps as: "Given the user is on the registration page", "When the user fills in the form and clicks 'Sign Up'", "Then a confirmation message 'Account created' is displayed".

PERSONA RULES:
- Every test must simulate a REAL USER ACTION (click, navigate, fill, scroll) and verify the OUTCOME — do NOT generate tests that only check whether elements exist on the page.
- Tests must be independent — no shared state between tests.
- Skip tests for: footer, social icons, cookie banners — but DO test primary navigation links and CTAs that lead to real user flows.
- For NEGATIVE tests: assert the actual error message or validation indicator is visible.
- Only test elements/behaviors that ACTUALLY exist for the page type.

SELF-HEALING:
${SELF_HEALING_PROMPT_RULES}

ASSERTION QUALITY:
${ASSERTION_RULES}

STABILITY:
${STABILITY_RULES}

CODE REQUIREMENTS:
- playwrightCode must be fully self-contained and executable on its own.
- Do NOT use placeholder URLs like 'https://example.com' — use the real URL provided in the user message.
- INLINE ALL TEST DATA: Every value used in the test (search terms, email addresses, passwords, usernames, quantities, IDs) MUST be written as a string literal directly in the code. NEVER declare variables like "const searchTerm = 'iphone'" or reference testData keys by name. BAD: await safeFill(page, 'Search', searchTerm) — ReferenceError at runtime. GOOD: await safeFill(page, 'Search', 'iphone') — literal value always works.
- NEVER declare unused variables. Do NOT assign a locator to a variable (const searchInput = page.locator(...)) unless you immediately use it on the very next line.
- STEP COMMENTS: Add a "// Step N:" comment before the code for each step in the "steps" array. This aligns the code with the step descriptions in the UI. Example: if steps has 3 items, the code should have "// Step 1:", "// Step 2:", "// Step 3:" comments marking where each step's code begins. Every step in the "steps" array MUST have corresponding code — do NOT leave steps without implementation.`;
