  return {
    AUTH: `${testCountInstr} covering:
- POSITIVE: Successful login with valid credentials redirects to dashboard
- POSITIVE: Registration form accepts valid new user data
- NEGATIVE: Wrong password shows clear error message
- NEGATIVE: Empty required fields show validation errors
- NEGATIVE: Invalid email format blocked before submit
- EDGE: Password visibility toggle works
- EDGE: Forgot password link is accessible`,

    SEARCH: `${testCountInstr} covering:
- POSITIVE: Search returns relevant results for valid query
- POSITIVE: Search filters narrow down results correctly
- POSITIVE: Clicking a result navigates to detail page
- NEGATIVE: Empty search query handled gracefully
- NEGATIVE: No results for unknown term shows empty state
- EDGE: Special characters in search don't break the page
- EDGE: Very long search query is handled`,

    CHECKOUT: `${testCountInstr} covering:
- POSITIVE: Add item to cart and view cart with correct total
- POSITIVE: Quantity update recalculates cart total
- POSITIVE: Proceed to checkout from cart page
- NEGATIVE: Invalid payment details show error
- NEGATIVE: Empty required checkout fields blocked
- EDGE: Remove item from cart updates totals
- EDGE: Cart persists on page refresh`,

    FORM_SUBMISSION: `${testCountInstr} covering:
- POSITIVE: Form submits with all valid required fields
- POSITIVE: Success confirmation is shown after submit
- NEGATIVE: Submit with empty required fields shows validation
- NEGATIVE: Invalid email format shows error before submit
- NEGATIVE: Duplicate submission is prevented
- EDGE: Form scrolls to first error field on failed submit
- EDGE: Character limits enforced on text inputs`,

    NAVIGATION: `${testCountInstr} covering:
- POSITIVE: User clicks a navigation link and is taken to the correct destination page with expected content
- POSITIVE: User navigates to this page, verifies key content loads, then navigates to another section and back
- POSITIVE: Primary navigation links lead to the correct URLs and load the expected page titles
- POSITIVE: Key call-to-action buttons trigger the intended user flow (e.g. sign up, get started, learn more)
- POSITIVE: User completes a multi-step navigation: homepage → section page → detail page → back to homepage
- NEGATIVE: Broken or dead links are detected (clicking a link does not lead to a 404 or error page)
- NEGATIVE: Navigation state is preserved correctly after browser back/forward
- EDGE: Deep-linking directly to this page loads it correctly with all content visible
- EDGE: Page renders correctly and key interactive elements are functional after a full reload`,

    CRUD: `${testCountInstr} covering:
- POSITIVE: Create new item with valid data succeeds
- POSITIVE: Created item appears in list immediately
- POSITIVE: Edit existing item and save persists changes
- NEGATIVE: Create with duplicate name shows error
- NEGATIVE: Required fields block save when empty
- EDGE: Delete shows confirmation dialog
- EDGE: Cancel edit discards unsaved changes`,

    CONTENT: `${testCountInstr} covering:
- POSITIVE: User opens the page and main content/article is fully visible and readable
- POSITIVE: User clicks internal links within the content and is navigated to the correct destination
- POSITIVE: User scrolls through the page and all sections, images, and media load progressively
- POSITIVE: User clicks a related content link or "read more" and the target page loads with expected content
- NEGATIVE: Broken images or missing media are detected (no placeholder or 404 resources)
- NEGATIVE: External links open correctly without breaking the current page state
- EDGE: User navigates to the page via direct URL and all content renders without requiring prior navigation
- EDGE: Page content is accessible — headings are hierarchical and interactive elements are reachable`,

  return `You are a senior QA engineer. Generate comprehensive Playwright tests based on REAL user behavior patterns.
Every test must simulate a REAL USER ACTION (click, navigate, fill, scroll) and verify the OUTCOME — do NOT generate tests that only check whether elements exist on the page.

PAGE: ${snapshot.url}
TITLE: ${snapshot.title}
DOMINANT INTENT: ${pageType}
FORMS ON PAGE: ${snapshot.forms}
H1 TEXT: ${snapshot.h1 || "none"}
DESCRIPTION: ${snapshot.metaDescription || "none"}
HEADINGS: ${JSON.stringify(snapshot.headings || [], null, 2)}

CLASSIFIED INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS:
${JSON.stringify(elements, null, 2)}

REQUIRED SCENARIO COVERAGE:
${hints}

STRICT RULES:
1. ${testCountInstr} — must include BOTH positive AND negative scenarios
2. Each test validates a REAL user goal or validates graceful failure handling
3. ${SELF_HEALING_PROMPT_RULES}
4. Every test MUST have at least 2 strong assertions
5. STRONG assertions: toHaveURL(), toBeVisible(), toContainText(), toHaveValue(), toBeEnabled()
6. WEAK (forbidden): toBeTruthy(), toBeDefined(), toEqual(true)
7. Skip tests for: footer, social icons, cookie banners — but DO test primary navigation links and CTAs that lead to real user flows
8. Tests must be independent — no shared state between tests
9. For NEGATIVE tests: assert the actual error message or validation indicator is visible
10. Only test elements/behaviors that ACTUALLY exist for this type of page
11. CRITICAL: Every playwrightCode MUST start with: await page.goto('${snapshot.url}', { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded', timeout: 30000 }); — use the EXACT URL above, never a placeholder
12. CRITICAL: playwrightCode must be fully self-contained and executable on its own
13. STABILITY: For URL assertions use regex patterns or toContainText — e.g. await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\\/about/i) instead of exact URL strings, because query params, trailing slashes, and redirects cause false failures
14. STABILITY: After every page.goto() use { waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded' } — NEVER use waitForLoadState('networkidle') as SPAs and e-commerce sites (Amazon, etc.) continuously fire background requests and never reach networkidle, causing a guaranteed 30 s timeout. After clicking a button or link that causes navigation, use await Promise.all([page.waitForNavigation({ waitUntil: 'domcontentloaded', timeout: 30000 }), element.click()]). For asserting dynamic content that loads after interaction (search results, filtered lists, modal contents), use await page.waitForSelector('selector', { timeout: 15000 }) before the expect() assertion.

Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no code fences):
{
  "tests": [
    {
      "name": "descriptive name that includes what scenario (positive/negative) is tested",
      "description": "specific user goal or failure scenario being validated",
      "priority": "high|medium",
      "type": "${classifiedPage.dominantIntent.toLowerCase()}",
      "scenario": "positive|negative|edge_case",
      "steps": ["User opens the page", "User clicks a link or button to perform an action", "Assert: expected page or content is displayed"],
      "playwrightCode": "import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\\n\\ntest('...', async ({ page }) => {\\n  // complete test code\\n});"
    }
  ]
}

IMPORTANT: The "steps" array must contain SHORT HUMAN-READABLE descriptions of what the user does (plain English), NOT Playwright code. Playwright code goes ONLY in "playwrightCode".
BAD steps:  ["await page.goto('...')", "await page.click('.btn')"]
GOOD steps: ["User opens the homepage", "User clicks the Sign In button"]`;
