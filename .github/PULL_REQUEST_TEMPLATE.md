- [ ] PR title follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (`feat:`, `fix:`, `perf:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, etc.)
- [ ] Branch is off `develop`, not `main`
- [ ] `cd backend && npm test` passes locally
- [ ] `cd frontend && npm run build && npm test` passes locally
- [ ] New/modified backend logic has tests registered in `backend/tests/run-tests.js`
- [ ] `docs/changelog.md` updated under `## [Unreleased]` (user-visible changes only)
- [ ] `QA.md` walked for affected flows; Golden E2E re-run if core flow was touched
- [ ] `permissions.json` updated if a `requireRole()` gate was added/changed
- [ ] No orphan backend routes (PROC-001): every new `router.<method>(…)` in `backend/src/routes/*.js` has a matching frontend consumer in this PR — `frontend/src/api.js` helper or a `frontend/src/pages/*.jsx` / `frontend/src/components/**/*.jsx` callsite. API-only PRs require a `[no-ui]` token in the PR title.
- [ ] ROADMAP.md + NEXT.md updated if this closes a roadmap item (see REVIEW.md)
- [ ] UI changes meet accessibility requirements (keyboard nav, ARIA roles, color contrast)
- [ ] No secrets, API keys, or credentials in the diff
